Pacman crashes during an upgrade
In the case that pacman crashes with a "database write" error while removing packages, and reinstalling or upgrading packages fails thereafter, do the following:

Boot using the Arch installation media. Preferably use a recent media so that the pacman version matches/is newer than the system.
Mount the system's root filesystem, e.g. mount /dev/sdaX /mnt as root, and check the mount has sufficient space with df -h
Mount the proc, sys and dev filesystems as well: mount -t proc proc /mnt/proc; mount --rbind /sys /mnt/sys; mount --rbind /dev /mnt/dev
If the system uses default database and directory locations, you can now update the system's pacman database and upgrade it via pacman --sysroot /mnt -Syu as root.
After the upgrade, one way to double-check for not upgraded but still broken packages: find /mnt/usr/lib -size 0
Followed by a re-install of any still broken package via pacman --sysroot /mnt -S package.

To be able to make further changes to the system, you need to arch-chroot into it with the Arch iso, and then you can perform these steps:

Fix Arch:

run rm /var/lib/pacman/db.lck to signal Pacman that there is no other instance of Pacman running

reinstall all dependencies:

pacman -Qqdn > pkglist_deps.txt

pacman --force --asdeps -S $(< pkglist_deps.txt)

3. reinstall all explicit packages:

pacman -Qqen > pkglist_exp.txt

pacman --force -S $(< pkglist_exp.txt)



Fix boot partition (specifically for systemd-boot):

copy bootloader config from /boot if possible

format boot partition and mount

install bootloader

bootctl install --path=<esp path>

4. configure bootloader, for systemd-boot it is <esp path>/loader/loader.conf and add at least one appropriate entry to <esp path>/loader/entries

5. force reinstall all packages that add files to boot, for me it was linux and intel-ucode

6. update /etc/fstab with the new UUID of the boot partition
